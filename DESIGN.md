## Application Spec.

- App should contain an index page where users can perform CRUD actions on intake forms (e.g., 'CRUD' intake forms) from. 
- The index page should display a table showing all submitted intake forms (in a real app only admins will be able to see the submissions list (or a separate app/page would be created where this would be the case).
- The app shouldn't require user login, thereby simulating the app in 'user logged-in' state;  E.g., whatever session is currently running is considered the logged in user (for our example).

### Intake Form workflow 

- ~~The user shouldn't be able to access Required form fields, marked as required (subsequent form pages will be inaccessible until required information is entered).~~
